// Per-turn, query-driven recall for athena-code.

// The frozen snapshot (snapshot.ts) is built once and carries a bounded memory
// slice. Recall is the volatile complement: for the CURRENT user turn it scores
// the full memory store against the user's text and returns only the most
// relevant entries, fenced as data. It is recomputed per turn (memoized by query
// so it is stable across a turn's tool-loop steps), never written to disk, and
// never persisted into history.
//
// Slice 1b scores the native memory store with lexical scoring.
// Slice 2 expands the same interface to an FTS index over past sessions.
